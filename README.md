# Metropolis Coffee

Welcome to my Code Kentucky session one final project. This is a webpage for a fake coffee shop in a fake town in the Midwest. The attempt here was to make an attractive, mobile first, functional webpage that would introduce the coffee shop to the public as well as provide some helpful information such as shop location and hours.

The features I've included are:
1. Create a responsive menu with CSS. My main menu responds to changes in page size, and on mobile devices colllapses into a hamburger menu.
2. Run PageSpeed Insights from google.com get a score of 60 or better. As of my last testing I was easily getting a better score than 60. 
3. Add your own transition animation(s) to an element on hover. Every link on my page uses custom colors as well as custom hover colors that use the "ease" transition.
4. Create a simple hide/show div with CSS. My "side-info" div shows itself at larger sizes, but in the smaller mobile viewing windows it is hidden.
